## Pre-trained Models
The pretrained X152-C4 object-attribute detection can be downloaded [here](https://penzhanwu2.blob.core.windows.net/results/vinvl/od_models/vinvl_vg_x152c4.pth).
With code from our [Scene Graph Benchmark Repo](https://github.com/microsoft/scene_graph_benchmark), one can extract features with following command:
```bash
python tools/test_sg_net.py --config-file sgg_configs/vgattr/vinvl_x152c4.yaml TEST.IMS_PER_BATCH 2 MODEL.WEIGHT models/vinvl/vinvl_vg_x152c4.pth MODEL.ROI_HEADS.NMS_FILTER 1 MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH 0.2 DATA_DIR "../maskrcnn-benchmark-1/datasets1" TEST.IGNORE_BOX_REGRESSION True MODEL.ATTRIBUTE_ON True TEST.OUTPUT_FEATURE True
```
The output feature will be encoded as base64. 

We also provide the X152-C4 objecte detection [config file](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/FourSets/config.yaml) and [pretrained model](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/FourSets/model_final.pth) on the merged four datasets (COCO with stuff, Visual Genome, Objects365 and Open Images). 
The labelmap to decode the 1848 can be found [here](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/FourSets/vgcocooiobjects_v1_class2ind.json). The first 1594 classes are exactly VG classes, with the same order. 
The map from COCO vocabulary to this merged vocabulary can be found [here](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/FourSets/coco_vgoiv6_class2ind.json).
The map from Objects365 vocabulary to this merged vocabulary can be found [here](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/FourSets/object365_vgoiv6_class2ind.json).
The map from OpenImages V5 vocabulary to this merged vocabulary can be found [here](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/FourSets/oi_vgoiv6_class2ind.json).

In addition, we provide a X152-C4 objecte detection [config file](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/objects365/attr_frcnn_X152C4.yaml) and [pretrained model](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/objects365/model_0740000.pth) on Objects365. Its labelmap to decode the object classes can be found [here](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/model_ckpts/od_models/objects365/train.labelmap.tsv).

## Pre-exacted Image Features
For ease-of-use, we make pretrained features and predictions available for all pretraining datasets and downstream tasks. 
Features are stored in tsv (tab-separated-values) format that can be used in [pretraining](oscar/datasets/oscar_tsv.py) and dowstream tasks like [COCO Image-Text Retrieval](oscar/run_retrieval.py).

### Oscar+ pretraining corpus
<img src="docs/pretrain_corpus.PNG" width="650"> 

[Small corpus](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/pretrain_corpus/coco_flickr30k_gqa.tsv)

[Medium corpus](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/pretrain_corpus/coco_flickr30k_gqa_oi.tsv)

[Large corpus](https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/pretrain_corpus/coco_flickr30k_googlecc_gqa_sbu_oi.tsv)

We have tried our best to make sure that there is no data contamination between pretraining corpus and test sets for downstream tasks. 
More specifically, we use two methods to achieve this. 
(1) We use the COCO Image ID of Visual Genome and Flickr30k images.
(2) For COCO, Visual Genome and Flickr30k, we calucate the pair-wise l2 norm between two images after resizing them into the same size.


## Oscar+ pretrained models and downstream tasks models
The code to produce all vision-language results (both pretraining and downstream task finetuning) can be found in our [OSCAR repo](https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar).
One can find the model zoo for vision-language tasks [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Oscar/blob/master/MODEL_ZOO.md).


### Note
It is recommended to download large files with **AzCopy** for faster speed.
AzCopy executable tools can be downloaded [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10#download-azcopy).
Decompress the tar file and put the executable in any path. To download from
any URL above, the command is:
```bash
path/to/azcopy copy <URL> <local_path>

# for example, downloading coco pre-extracted features and predictions
path/to/azcopy copy https://biglmdiag.blob.core.windows.net/vinvl/image_features/coco_X152C4_frcnnbig2_exp168model_0060000model.roi_heads.nm_filter_2_model.roi_heads.score_thresh_0.2/model_0060000/ <local_path> --recursive
```
